**SWF-Angular** is an simple angular library I've created some time ago to utilize **Spring Web Flow** within
Angular environment. However it is not finished and properly tested I managed to use it to integrate my app (written in angular) to be
used with SWF. 

Feel free to fork it and develop it if You need it.
